what is a hash function:
hasing is the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed size string of text using a mathematical function:
this mean that any text, no matter how long it is, can be converted into an array of numbers and letters throught algorithm(like 38ere4fe32fe5utjwir2r3)
input + hash function = hash value(output)
for a input the hash value is always the same one and for two different inputs the hash value are always different.
