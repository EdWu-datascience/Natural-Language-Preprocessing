what is a hash function:
hasing is the process of converting an input of any length into a fixed size string of text using a mathematical function:
this mean that any text, no matter how long it is, can be converted into an array of numbers and letters throught algorithm(like 38ere4fe32fe5utjwir2r3)
input + hash function = hash value(output)
for a input the hash value is always the same one and for two different inputs the hash value are always different.
hash table:
for instance: we now have a list of text = ['tim','ed','sid','john']
we get the ASCII of each letter in each name and sum them together and then mode by size of array: index number = sum ASCII codes Mod size of array
collisions in hash table: it's common that different name got the same index number. in this case, we first see if the place is empty, we move to right if not empty
another solution to this problem:if this place is not empty, we use a pointer that point to our new data(just like each place has a listnode)
